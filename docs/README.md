# ðŸ“˜ Project Documentation

This folder contains detailed documentation for the Quant AI Platform.

Sections to include:
- `architecture.md`: System layout, agent flow, dependencies
- `how-to.md`: Step-by-step user and dev instructions
- `glossary.md`: Definitions for key terms (e.g., OHLCV, IQR, etc.)
- `changelog.md`: Updates and version tracking

Each doc should be easy to read and kept updated by relevant agents or humans.
